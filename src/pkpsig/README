Copied out of pkpsig-c-impl commit 5ad1cfc5261d4bb5d35db56b8b42173510d5704f
and tweaked as follows:

# Files from include/pkpsig/ were moved to this directory.

# Files with .c extensions from src/ were renamed to start with: pkps-

sed -E -i -e 's|<pkpsig/(.*\.h)>|"\1"|' pkpsig/*

# pkps-randombytes.c was rewritten to call out to the routines in
# PuTTY's sshrand.c .
